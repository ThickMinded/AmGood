# AmGood
Who knew an EXE could be this annoying without admin rights? AmGood pushes a system to its limits—maxing CPU, GPU, visuals, and volume. Low-end PCs might just tap out. No system files touched, just pure chaos for testing. Use responsibly, I’m not responsible. Works best with the included JDK.

😈 AmGood – The Experiment in System Interference Without Admin Privileges
⚠️ Disclaimer: This is NOT malware. This is purely a test of how much a normal .exe file can do without admin rights.
I built AmGood as an experiment to explore how deep a simple executable can reach without administrative privileges. It does not modify system files, does not install anything malicious, and does not require elevated permissions.

However, let’s be clear: this program is extremely annoying and intrusive. It pushes Windows to its limits at the user level, testing how much chaos can be caused without breaking major security barriers. Use it responsibly. I am not responsible for how you use this program or any consequences that arise from it.

That being said, the code is absolutely horrible. 💀 It’s inefficient, clunky, and far from optimized. Could I have written it better? Absolutely. Did I care? Not at all. As long as it works, that’s all that matters to me.

🏴‍☠️ What Does AmGood Actually Do?
If you’re looking for highly optimized, well-structured code, you are in the wrong place. This is a hacked-together mess that just gets the job done. Here's what AmGood does:

🎨 Visual Disruption
Covers your screen with flashing colors, glitchy error messages, and hazard symbols.
Randomly traps your mouse in a specific area (so you can’t escape).
Generates fake system warnings and creepy error messages like “WHO’S WATCHING YOU?”.
Constant graphical interference that makes it really annoying to use your PC normally.
🔊 Forces System Volume to Maximum
Continuously forces the system volume up.
Even if you try to lower it, it immediately increases back.
Uses PowerShell key emulation to press Volume Up automatically.
💻 CPU Overload & Stress Test
Constantly monitors CPU usage.
If CPU usage is below 100%, it starts an artificial stress test to overload the system.
Uses brute-force calculations to max out the CPU, making the system extremely slow.
On low-end systems, this often leads to an automatic system crash.
🚀 Adds Itself to Windows Startup
Automatically copies itself to the Windows Startup folder.
This makes it launch every time you start your computer.
You must manually remove it from Startup to stop it.
🔍 Task Manager Detection
If you try to open Task Manager, it knows.
You might think you're smart, but the program will react accordingly.
🛑 Shutdown Prevention & Secret Escape Sequence
The program does not close easily.
There is, however, a secret shutdown sequence:
Press A + S on your keyboard.
If entered correctly, AmGood will stop and exit.
(Good luck remembering that while your screen is flashing like a haunted computer.)
🔧 What You Need to Run AmGood
Since this program is not optimized for portability, you must install a few dependencies before running it:

✅ Required Installations
Java Development Kit (JDK) – Version 8 or Higher 🛠️

I will upload a pre-configured JDK that works perfectly with AmGood.
If you want to install it yourself, get JDK 8 or later.
JavaFX – For Media Playback 🎥

AmGood plays videos as part of its disruption, so JavaFX is required.
If your JDK does not include JavaFX, install it separately.
JNativeHook – For Global Key Listening 🎹

This allows AmGood to detect keyboard shortcuts even when the window is not in focus.
You can download it from JNativeHook GitHub.
💡 Why Did I Make This?
The real reason I created AmGood is simple:

I wanted to test the boundaries of a normal .exe file without admin rights.
I was curious to see how much disruption could be achieved at the user level.
Could I have made a program that just makes a computer completely unusable?
Yes. But that wouldn't be funny.
Instead, I wanted something annoying but functional—something that makes people think, "How is this even possible without admin?"
I’ve tested AmGood on various systems, and low-end systems struggle the most—sometimes crashing automatically due to the CPU and GPU overload.

⚠️ Important Notes & Final Warning
This program is NOT designed to be efficient. It’s a horrible mess, but it works, so I don’t care.
This does NOT require admin privileges. Everything runs at the user level.
This is for fun, not for harm. Don’t use this to mess with people in ways that could cause real issues.
You will probably need Task Manager to kill it if you forget the shutdown shortcut.
If you use this program, use it responsibly. I am not responsible for any misuse, data loss, crashes, or unexpected behaviors caused by AmGood.
📝 Final Thoughts
AmGood is a ridiculous, chaotic, and inefficient mess, but it proves a point.

If you’re interested in exploring the limits of what a simple Windows program can do without admin rights, this project is for you.

Otherwise, you should probably stay far, far away from it.

🔻 You have been warned. 😈
