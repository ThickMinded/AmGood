# 😈 AmGood – The Experiment in System Interference Without Admin Privileges 🎭

## ⚠️ Disclaimer
This is **NOT** malware. AmGood is a test to see how much chaos a normal `.exe` can cause **without admin privileges**. It **does not** modify system files, install malicious software, or require elevated permissions. 

However, **this program is extremely annoying**. It pushes Windows to its **absolute limits** at the user level, testing just how disruptive an executable can be **without breaking security barriers**. **Use it responsibly**—I am **not responsible** for any consequences that arise from using this program.

That being said, **this code is an absolute mess**. 💀 Could I have written it better? **Yes.** Did I care? **Not at all.** As long as it works, that’s all that matters.

## 🏴‍☠️ What Does AmGood Actually Do?

If you're looking for **clean, optimized code**, you are **in the wrong place**. This is a **hacked-together** mess that simply gets the job done.

### 🎨 Visual Disruption
- Covers your screen with **flashing colors, glitchy text, and fake error messages**.
- **Traps your mouse** in a specific area (so you **can't escape**).
- Generates **fake system warnings** like *"WHO'S WATCHING YOU?"* and *"SYSTEM FAILURE."*
- **Makes it nearly impossible** to use your PC normally.

### 🔊 Forces System Volume to Maximum
- **Continuously forces volume up** (even if you try to lower it).
- Uses **PowerShell key emulation** to **spam Volume Up**.

### 💻 CPU Overload & Stress Test
- **Maxes out CPU usage** whenever it's below 100%.
- Uses brute-force calculations to **make the system slow and unresponsive**.
- On **low-end systems**, this often results in an **automatic system crash**.

### 🚀 Adds Itself to Windows Startup
- **Automatically copies itself** to the Windows Startup folder.
- **Launches on every reboot** until manually removed.

### 🔍 Task Manager Detection
- **Knows when Task Manager is opened**.
- Reacts accordingly when you try to shut it down.

### 🛑 Shutdown Prevention & Secret Escape Sequence
- **AmGood does NOT close easily.**
- There is, however, a **secret shutdown sequence**:
  - **Press A + S** on your keyboard.
  - If entered correctly, **AmGood will stop and exit**.

(Good luck remembering that **while your screen is flashing** like a haunted computer.)

## 🔧 What You Need to Run AmGood
Since this program isn't designed for portability, you **must** install a few dependencies before running it.

### ✅ Required Installations
1. **Java Development Kit (JDK) – Version 8 or Higher** 🛠️
   - I will **upload a pre-configured JDK** that works perfectly with AmGood.
   - If installing yourself, **JDK 8 or later** is required.

2. **JavaFX – For Media Playback** 🎥
   - AmGood plays videos as part of its disruption, so **JavaFX is required**.
   - If your JDK **does not** include JavaFX, install it separately.

3. **JNativeHook – For Global Key Listening** 🎹
   - Allows AmGood to detect keyboard shortcuts even **when the window is not in focus**.
   - Can be downloaded from the **JNativeHook GitHub**.

## 💡 Why Did I Make This?
The real reason I created AmGood is simple:

- I wanted to **test the boundaries** of what a normal `.exe` can do **without admin rights**.
- I was curious **how much disruption** could be achieved at the **user level**.
- Could I have made a program that **completely locks a computer**? **Yes.**
- Could I have made it **auto-crash Windows** on boot? **Yes.**
- **But that wouldn't be funny.**
- Instead, I wanted **something annoying but functional**—something that **makes people question how it even works**.

I've tested AmGood on **various systems**, and **low-end PCs struggle the most**—some **crash automatically** due to **CPU and GPU overload**.

## ⚠️ Important Notes & Final Warning
- **This program is NOT optimized.** It’s a chaotic mess, **but it works, so I don’t care.**
- **No admin rights are required.** Everything runs at **user level**.
- **This is for fun, not for harm.** Don't use this to mess with people **in ways that could cause real issues**.
- **You’ll probably need Task Manager** to kill it if you forget the **shutdown shortcut**.
- **If you use this program, use it responsibly.**  
  **I am NOT responsible for any misuse, data loss, crashes, or unexpected behaviors caused by AmGood.**

## 📝 Final Thoughts
AmGood is **ridiculous, chaotic, and inefficient**—but it **proves a point**.

If you’re interested in **exploring the limits** of what a simple Windows program **can do without admin rights**, this project is for you.

Otherwise, you should **probably stay far, far away from it**.

🔻 **You have been warned.** 😈
