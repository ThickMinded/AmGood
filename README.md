# AmGood
Who knew an EXE could be this annoying without admin rights? AmGood pushes a system to its limits—maxing CPU, GPU, visuals, and volume. Low-end PCs might just tap out. No system files touched, just pure chaos for testing. Use responsibly, I’m not responsible. Works best with the included JDK.
